## üîÑ Three-Dimensional Classification

Every AI-SWE task is evaluated across three critical dimensions:

### üìè **Scope Measure**
- **Function-level**: Single, self-contained functions (HumanEval, MBPP)
- **Unit-level**: Larger chunks, files, classes (FullStackBench, BigCodeBench)  
- **Project-level**: Entire repositories (SWE-Bench, Commit0)

### üß† **Logical Complexity**
- **Low**: Simple CRUD operations, basic API usage
- **Medium**: LeetCode problems, multithreaded reasoning
- **High**: Competition programming, cryptographic analysis, complex algorithms

### üë• **Human Intervention Level**
- **Low Autonomy**: Human-controlled with AI assistance
- **Medium Autonomy**: Collaborative human-AI coordination
- **High Autonomy**: AI-driven with human oversight
