**Speaker Notes**: 
"Welcome everyone. Today we're diving into a fascinating paper that challenges how we think about AI in software engineering. The key message? AI's role is getting way broader than just writing code snippets."

---

## **Slide 2: The Key Takeaway**
### **üéØ AI's Expanding Role**

> **"AI's role in software is getting way broader than just writing code snippets"**

**Current Reality**: AI writes functions  
**Future Vision**: AI as comprehensive software engineering assistant

**Visual**: Timeline animation from "Code Completion 2021" ‚Üí "Full SWE Assistant 2030+"

**Speaker Notes**:
"This isn't just about better autocomplete. We're talking about AI that understands the entire software development lifecycle - from planning to deployment to maintenance."

---

## **Slide 3: The Framework Introduction**
### **üìä How Do We Think About AI-SWE Tasks?**

**The Three-Dimensional Measurement System:**
- üîç **Scope**: How big is the change?
- üß† **Logical Complexity**: How much reasoning required?
- ü§ù **Human Intervention**: How much collaboration needed?

**Visual**: 3D cube showing the intersection of all three dimensions

**Speaker Notes**:
"The authors provide us with a structured way to think about this. Instead of just asking 'can AI code?', they ask three specific questions that help us understand exactly what we're measuring."

---

## **Slide 4: Scope Dimension**
### **üîç Scope - How Big is the Change?**

#### **Function Level** ‚Üí **Unit Level** ‚Üí **Project Level**
- **Function**: Single functions (HumanEval, MBPP)
- **Unit**: Files, classes (FullStackBench, BigCodeBench)  
- **Project**: Entire repositories (Commit0, SWE-Bench)

**Visual**: Zoom-out animation from single function ‚Üí file ‚Üí entire repository

**Speaker Notes**:
"This distinction is critical. Modifying one function versus refactoring a whole project are totally different beasts. Current benchmarks mostly test function-level tasks, but real software engineering happens at all three levels."

---

## **Slide 5: Complexity & Intervention**
### **üß† Logical Complexity + ü§ù Human Intervention**

#### **Logical Complexity**
- **Low**: CRUD apps, simple APIs
- **Medium**: LeetCode problems, basic concurrency

**Visual**: Roadblock icons with progress bars showing current capability levels

**Speaker Notes**:
"Now for the reality check. The podcast hosts did a great job putting the hype into perspective. Let's look at what's actually holding us back."

---

## **Slide 12: Evaluation Crisis**
### **üìä Challenge 1: "Our measuring sticks might be misleading us"**

#### **The Problems:**
- **Narrow focus**: Too much emphasis on simple function completion
- **Data contamination**: Did the model see the test during training?
- **Construct validity**: High scores ‚â† better developer experience

#### **The Quote:**
*"Benchmarks aren't capturing reality well enough"*

**Visual**: Graph showing benchmark scores vs real developer satisfaction (inverse correlation)

**Speaker Notes**:
"This is fundamental. If we can't measure progress accurately, how do we know we're actually making progress? Current benchmarks miss most of what software engineering actually involves."

---

## **Slide 13: Tool Integration Gap**
### **üîß Challenge 2: "Development isn't just typing code into a void"**

#### **What Real Engineers Use:**
Linters ‚Ä¢ Debuggers ‚Ä¢ Profilers ‚Ä¢ Build systems ‚Ä¢ Version control ‚Ä¢ IDEs ‚Ä¢ Terminals

#### **What Current AI Uses:**
Text generation *(and that's about it)*

#### **The Vision:**
"Agent-Computer Interface" for seamless tool orchestration

**Visual**: Side-by-side comparison of human developer workflow vs AI workflow

**Speaker Notes**:
"This gap is huge. Real development is about orchestrating dozens of tools. Current AI is mostly just sophisticated autocomplete."

---

## **Slide 14: Human Collaboration Problems**
### **ü§ù Challenge 3: "The prompt engineering dance is frustrating"**

#### **The Current Experience:**
1. Give vague instructions
2. AI generates plausible but wrong code  
3. Try again with different prompt
4. Repeat...

#### **Real Example - Astropy Issue:**
AI wrote data serializer but completely forgot the deserializer
*(The implicit knowledge wasn't captured)*

**Visual**: Frustration cycle diagram with real developer quotes

**Speaker Notes**:
"Anyone who's used these tools recognizes this dance. Unlike human colleagues, AI rarely asks clarifying questions - it just guesses, often wrongly."

---

## **Slide 15: Semantic Understanding Gap**
### **üß≠ Challenge 6: "They know the words but not the story"**

#### **Missing Holistic View:**
- Overall codebase structure and relationships
- How algorithms actually work
- Key invariants and constraints
- Cross-component dependencies

#### **The Problem:**
*"Trained on generation, not comprehensive analysis"*

**Visual**: Network diagram showing complex codebase relationships that AI misses

**Speaker Notes**:
"This might be the deepest challenge. Models are trained to predict the next token, not to understand the grand architecture of software systems."

---

## **Slide 16: Version Currency Crisis**
### **üîÑ Challenge 8: "The ground is always shifting"**

#### **Real Examples of Version Chaos:**
- **React Hooks**: Paradigm shift from classes to functional components
- **Python typing**: Module imports ‚Üí built-in types
