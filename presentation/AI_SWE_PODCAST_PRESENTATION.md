- **Natural language → Code**: Direct generation from descriptions
- **Multi-modal**: Sketches → Webpages, UI mockups → Frontend

### **2. Code Transformation** 🔄
*"Taking working code and making it better"*

#### **Refactoring**
- React Fiber rewrite - massive performance overhaul
- Rule of three: refactor after seeing pattern three times
- Focus on maintainability without changing behavior

#### **Migration & Translation**  
- **Scala 2.13 → 3**: Year-long effort, macro changes
- **COBOL → Java**: 220 billion lines still in production
- **C → Rust**: Memory safety push (DARPA involved)
- **Twitter**: Ruby → Java/Scala for 3x latency improvement

#### **Optimization**
- **Google Chrome V8**: 20x performance improvement over decades
- **Concurrent garbage collection**: 100x bloat reduction
- **TurboFan compiler**: 5-10% speed improvements

### **3. Software Testing & Program Analysis** 🔬
*"The never-ending battle to find bugs"*

#### **Testing Approaches**
- **Unit testing**: Input-output verification
- **Property-based testing**: Formal specification testing
- **Fuzzing**: Google's OSS-Fuzz finding vulnerabilities within hours
- **Mutation testing**: Meta's ACH system (73% acceptance rate)

#### **Program Analysis**
- **Vulnerability detection**: Zero-day exploit discovery
- **Invariant detection**: Automatic property inference
- **Static analysis**: Code structure and flow analysis

### **4. Software Maintenance** 🛠️
*"Where most projects spend most of their time and money"*
- **Documentation generation**: Automated doc strings and summaries
- **Pull request review**: Style checks, bug detection, test validation
- **Code understanding**: Navigation and question answering for large codebases

### **5. Scaffolding & Meta-Code** 🏗️
*"The essential but less glamorous parts"*
- **Scaffolding**: Authentication, APIs, databases, file storage
- **Meta-code**: Test harnesses, CI/CD, Dockerfiles, Makefiles
- **Infrastructure-as-Code**: Terraform configuration generation
- **Security policies**: IAM roles, access controls

### **6. Formal Verification** ✅
*"Mathematical proofs that code is correct"*
- **Full Functional Verification**: Complete specification proving
- **Property Verification**: Specific critical property validation
- **Safety-critical examples**: Ariane 5 rocket, Therac-25 radiation therapy
- **Success stories**: CompCert verified compiler, seL4 microkernel

## ⚠️ **The Nine Critical Challenges**

### **1. Evaluation & Benchmarks** 📊
*"Our measuring sticks might be misleading us"*
- Too focused on simple function completion
- Data contamination concerns
- Poor construct validity (high scores ≠ better developer experience)
- Missing diversity in task coverage

### **2. Effective Tool Usage** 🔧
*"Development isn't just typing code into a void"*
- Real engineers use entire ecosystems: linters, debuggers, profilers
- Current AI mostly generates text, doesn't integrate tools
- Need "Agent-Computer Interface" for tool orchestration

### **3. Human-AI Collaboration** 🤝
*"The prompt engineering dance is frustrating"*
- Vague instructions → plausible but wrong outputs
- Limited controllability and steering mechanisms
- AI rarely asks clarifying questions
- Missing implicit knowledge and context

**Example**: Astropy issue - AI wrote serializer but forgot deserializer

### **4. Long-Horizon Code Planning** 🎯
*"Short-term focus vs. architectural wisdom"*
- Poor at designing lasting abstractions
- Struggle with modularity and code quality
- Focus on local correctness over maintainability
- Don't leverage existing libraries effectively

### **5. Large Scope & Long Contexts** 📏
*"Needing a map of the whole city, not just the street"*
- Real codebases: millions of lines (Google: billions)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) limitations
- Poor semantic understanding of retrieved context

**Example**: Chart.js - BM25 retrieval completely missed relevant files

### **6. Semantic Understanding** 🧭
*"They know the words but not the story"*
- Lack holistic view of codebase structure
- Missing algorithmic understanding and invariants
- Trained on generation, not comprehensive analysis
- Knowledge doesn't transfer between coding tasks

### **7. Low-Resource Languages** 🌐
*"Trying to speak a language with only a few phrases"*
- Models excel in Python/Java/JavaScript
- Syntax errors in unfamiliar languages
- Hallucinate non-existent library functions

**Examples**: 
- Triton GPU language syntax failures
- Lean theorem proving - inventing theorems

### **8. Library & API Version Updates** 🔄
*"The ground is always shifting"*
- Software constantly evolving
- Models trained on snapshots struggle with currency
- Mix syntax from different versions

**Examples**:
- React Hooks paradigm shift
- Python typing module → built-ins
- Lean 3 vs Lean 4 incompatibility

### **9. High Logical Complexity** 🎓
*"Tasks hard even for expert humans"*
- Novel algorithm invention
- Specialized domain knowledge required
- Limited training data for cutting-edge problems
- Poor feedback mechanisms for learning

**Example**: File system verification with custom Crash Hoare Logic
